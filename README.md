- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Dharmawan.
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Design and Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity as well as Game Data systems.
- 💞️ I’m currently working full time and working on multiple private projects, so as of now I am not looking to collaborate on any projects. I am, however, looking for artists that are open to comission to draw illustrations for a card game. Do leave me an email if you are interested!
- 📫 You can reach me at d.harmawan.joshua@gmail.com
